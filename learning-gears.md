# Learning Gears

The most common question I get when people hear about [#LearnInPublic](link to twitter) is how to start.

In a sense, this is a Bad Questionâ„¢. What worked for me may or may not work for you. I don't know your situation, your interests, nor your skills. This is why [the original post](learn-in-public.md) just gives an open ended list of ideas. Being overly prescriptive limits your personal expression, which I hate.

But I undestand the desire for more structure. This is a new muscle to develop. Our entire childhoods we've been training to learn in private. Now you're trying this new thing. It'd be nice to have a map.

In the year Since I wrote that article, I've stumbled my way towards some sense of what *modes* of Learning In Public have had disproportionate effectiveness, some by practicing it myself, some by observing others. I finally feel this is worth sharing, so I'll answer this question I've been avoiding.

# Three Gears

I can think of three gears of Learning in Public.

## Explorer

Your **Exporer** gear is your first gear, starting off at every stop street. You're just trying to cover as much ground as possible, in many directions.
- The main **problem** to solve is that **you don't know what you don't know**.
- The **creative exhaust** you make are **mainly notes to self**, possibly in terms only you understand, possibly noting problems only you have. This is mostly in gists and blogposts and tweets or StackOverflow questions, because text is cheap to produce, although Twitch streams are also on the rise. The private alternative are notebooks and scratch files used to summarize complexity. You are often laying out literally your entire state of knowledge for [a metaphorical rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), looking for holes and documenting for the future.
- Your public output is episodic - there is **no unifying theme** - you are just a field correspondent reporting from whatever foreign land you find yourself in. This is still useful, because you [can't connect the dots until much later in life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA).
- The **public commitment** level is low, usually doable in one day sprints, so this is a great way to get started Learning in Public and also finding what resonates so you can switch gears. It is easy to fall off the wagon though, because no one's really expecting anything from you, because you haven't *committed* that much.

## Connector

Most people should aim for your **Connector** gear to be their defaults. This is a powerful, yet nimble gear. You connect people and ideas.

- The main **problem** to solve is that **you know things many don't know**. Hence you should share that and they need to hear you. That takes a little extra effort.
- The **creative exhause** you make is **explicitly meant for others**. This means some effort is required that isn't just about your learning, but more about making things easy to digest. Here are the talks, tutorials, cartoons, cheatsheets, books, etc. - Higher effort, hiigher usefulness, longer lasting. You usually aren't sharing everything you know, though, so it can feel like you're learning less. However, this is the best way to master fundamentals because yu are forced to cover your bases and be able to answer questions you haven't thought to ask.
- You still have a grand **theme** to work, but usually you are **juggling multiple themes**, and also learning and teaching about their interesections.
- The **public commitment** is moderate - usually for a few weeks or months - and often involves active exercise of soft skills that you may feel ill equipped for. Check your ego at the door and learn that too. You are "putting yourself out there". But also remember Learning In Public is an art, not a science: always rely on and refine your *taste* rather than objectively trying to please everyone. Find *your* people, lean on strenghts you always thought were irrelevant for coding.

## Miner

Reserve the **Miner** gear for when you've struck gold. Something that resonates with people, that you are also abnormally fascinated by. When you strike gold, you'll know. Stop and plant your flag.

- The main **problem** to solve is that something important is too hard, or the world knows too little about something this important. Therefore **you dive deep into something nobody else does**.
- The **creative exhause** you make is very specialized - you **do research and build community and infrastructure**. What you do is **meant to last**. Before you, the thing was very hard, or impossible. After you, the thing becomes much easier. The wodl will thank you.
- You have one **theme** that not just unifies your work, but that you become synonymous with. Every person in the world has the problem you solve, eventually find you, bevause that is how the Internet Works. (Coincidentally, you no longer need to "put yourself out there", people will come to you.) This might feel boring since you're just about one thing all the time, but what seems like one topic to you today (e.g. Machine Learning) will eventually subdivide into different disciplines when you go deep enough (e.g. Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning).
- The **public commitment** is very high - on the order of years and careers. You're digging a mine and spend energy far more than any other sane person is doing - it helps if the area you've chosen has a good chance of widening and deepening at the same time you're mining. So have some form of macros thesis for why this field in general will be increasingly important. (More on this in future writing.)

# Why Gears

These are "gears" and not "levels" or "modes" because you can step in and out of any gear depending on what kind of terrain you're on and how fast and deep you need to go. (I bike a lot so I just like the analogy of "gears" - I also like the implicaton that one gear isn't necessarily better or worese than another, it just depends, and also adopting one gear does mean trading off speed or power.)

# What do I do now?

If you're ust starting to #LearnInPublic, start as an **Explorer**. Map out whatever you're learning, whatever tickles your fancy. Go as fast as you like, an inch deep and a mile wide.

When you have a good sense of the terrain and see other Explorers you can help, start being a **Connector**. Link people and ideas, use your full creative talent. Go back and cover gaps in your knowledge.

If you find yourself tripping over gold, start **Mining**. If it turns out a dud, switch gears. No sweat.

Three gears of learning, all in Public. We're cheering you on.
