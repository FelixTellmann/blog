# Source doe for Life v0.1

Welcome. In this first [12 week year](link to book) of 2020 I summarized 80 popular books, nearly one for every day of the year.

- I let whim and interest guide my book choice, but they tended to be around the top recommended lists of gurus and entrepreneuers.
- I think learning needs ot be complemented by doing, so for the next 12 week year of 2020 I will only be executing the source code I have compiled ehre.
- Your milage may vary when reading jumbled thoughts from random self-help-gurus.
- I am merely open sourcing what resonates with me. I'd love for you to write your own version of this, ESPECIALLY if you disagree.

What follows is compiled insights fro Infinite Learners. Enjoy. You can [Watch this Github Repo for future updates](link to repo).

# Top level Rules

> The topics I have split out below constist of: **Productivity**, **Interpersonal Skills**, **Sales & Psychology**, **Tech Leadership**, **Life & Career Philosophy**, and **Mental Models and Systems Thinking**. It is highlighy artifical to split these interrelated things, so I extracted the most important, common threads among them to this top level Section.


### Micros: Tactical Rules to run your life

-  Smile! It makes you, not just people around you, feel better. :-)
- Learning is more important than earning.
- You brain is not a storage device. Have a system to write stuff down (say, on you blog?) and make it organizable and searchable.
- Play to your strengths, hire and work with other people based on their strengths.
- Remember the power of storytelling. A good story has more power than a good argument.
- Take pride in artistry in your work, and be generous with the results. People crave the authenticity only you can provide.
- Mastery is achieved by having a craftsman mindset focusing on rare and valuable skills, making small bets with remarkable end goal, in the Adjacent Possible. (be [So Good They Can't Ignore You](link to))
- Always be on the lookout for your Purpose in life, and when you find it, align everything to it. As a company, rally employees and customers to your Purpose too. When you find youself in [Flow](link to flow), that's a big hint.
- **Flow is everything**. Seek out jobs where you can exist in a Flow state. Arrange your environment, calendar, and life around optimizing your time spend in Flow. Your best work will be done here, and the world will reward you for it. Ignore the noise that aims to interrupt your Flow. Destroy, eliminate, extinguish, kill with fire the Unimportant things that pretend to be Urgent (like notifications).
- Understand what people want. There are many, many, many theories of what people want, but the three big ones are the study of Incentives, of Motivation and of Fascination.

### Macros: Big truths to shape your worldview

- Stoicism will get you through tough times and not mislead you during emotional highs and flashes of anger.
- Technology has profoundly changed so, so many of the rules of our society and economy.
    - The dominant Medium of our era defines our ideas of trugth.
    - Companies and experts used to profit from information asymmetry, and now have to find better ways of delivering value.
    - Effective marketing has switched from constantly interrupting you (eh with commercials and banner ads) to having your permission (eg with blogs and newsletter and referrals codes).
    - The Information Age valued left-brain skills, but as these get commoditized and automated, the "Conceptual Age" may now put right-brain aptitudes like Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning on top.
- Understand the [12 Leverage Points in All Systems](link to): Parameters < Buffer Size < Structure < Delay < Negative feedback < Positive feedback < Info Flow < Rules < Self Organization < Goals < Mindset < Transcendence.

# Productivity

- Your brain is not a storage device. Put ideas and tasks in a central source of truth, for example a checklist or Trello baord. Modern human knowledge is too huge to store, organize, and apply all within our brains.
- Discard things that have served their purpose. Say **No** more often.
- Don't multitask. Multitasking is not Productivity.
- Your willpower is limited.
- Be proactive, take control.
- Begin with the end in mind: have a Mission, Vision, and specific Goals.
- Put first things first. Urgent != Important; do Urgent & Important things first, then Important Non-urgent things. Avoid any Unimportant things.
- Sharpen the Saw and Recharge. Make sure to balance personal with professional life.
- Make room and Define your working space. Define your work time vs free time. Define your online time vs offline time. Boundaries help you do deep work.
- Do premortems envisioning how your project might fail. Talk to your future self, and use the "uh-oh" effect to spurt to a strong finish.
- Use short Checklists to prevent avoidable mistakes, and schedule communication for teams.

# Sales & Psychology

>We justify our actions, not vice versa.
>40% of actions are unconscious habit. Habit stick because you crave reward. Redirct your cravings, don't resist them.
>Habits are formed through a Trigger -> Action -> Reward -> Investement cycle. Spot companies doing this to you, and use it responsibly.
