How to boost your productivity with this simple Chrome extension.

Have you ever found yourself stuck at a project, where you have a number of
 tasks lined up and a number of projects running in parallel? Instead of
  tackling one projects' task, you jump between projects, get stuck having to
   learn something new and end up with a videos of cats & dogs because they
    are way more entertaining? We've all been there, 20 tabs open in the
     browser, thinking that we definitely will go back to all of them. Trying
      to do research and completing tasks at the same time, just isn't how we
       are meant to do things.


Today we are going to build a simple app that plugs into the popular browser Chrome, that will allow you to manage
 your projects and time more efficiently. The reason why we aim for a browser
  extension is that we do most of our work using the web browser.
