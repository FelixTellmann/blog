# Project Ideas for my Portfolio
Projects that are useful to myself and others. The primary aim is to have projects that create *value* first and then
look and feel good too.
 
## Project Ideas:
1. Chrome Project Management App  
   Focus on increasing productivity and provide clarity for lined-up tasks.     
   // TODO Find Name for the app  
   1. Temporary disable/eliminate distractions (pomodor timer based?) - hide/remove Tabs from chrome, save for later
    re-use - (Blacklist/whitelist  specific pages?)
   2. Time Keeping - tracking of tasks performance - counter
   3. Time Management integration via Wakatime - visualization chart to see performance on coding.
   4. Project Organizer - Task Manager - add/remove/complete tasks time assign ? Calendar?
   5. Easy of Access Platform - DragNDrop add bookmarks as icons for specific resources - Can change based on active
    project? ie. restaurant work vs shopify vs blogging? that would be pretty cool!
   6. Design based on brand style & personal brand styleguide? React.js

2. Personal Porfolio website & blogging platform  
   As the name implies. My personal website to show who I am, and to share knowledge via my blog.

3. Brand Style Component Library - like Shopify Polaris - for internal use and as a platform for all my projects to
 be universally branded by my scheme.
