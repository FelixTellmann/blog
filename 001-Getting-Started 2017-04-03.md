# Getting Started with my Blog

This is my first blog post that I'm putting together to, well, show what a blog post would look & feel like on my website.
I'm not 100% sure what it will entail just yet, so I'm going to let it write itself. Let's begin, shall we?

I've been virtually silent, unless you count all those facebook shares, which I don't. I want to share my thoughts, learnings,
tutorials, photographs, code snippets, and the like.

Writing helps me put my thoughts together. I'm incoherent most of the time  unless I take a moment to collect my thoughts 
and write them down. Most of the time my mind goes on its own journey or I get lost with hundreds of browser tabs. 
Writing is a sanity check and I welcome the challenge it presents. It's one thing to have a thought, but it's another 
to be able to craft that into something that's understandable to others.

## Challenge Accepted
It's really an experiment of self-development. If I do something enough, presumable I'll get better at it. Coupled with 
feedback from others, it's a win-win situation every time I sit down to write. That said, I don't want to limit myself 
to just writing. I envision this blog as a showcase for:

* Code Snippets & Tutorials
* Development Workflow Challenges
* Best practices & Guidelines
* Coding Tools & Resources
* Creating value & making money with code
* Learning & Meta Learning
* Working in the Cloud from anywhere
* And more?

So based on that, keep a watchful eye on everything that Iâ€™ll be sharing. And sitback and enjoy!
