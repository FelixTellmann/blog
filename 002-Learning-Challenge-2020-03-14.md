# Learning Curriculum

A focused approach to master software and web development (and probably other skills as well). The core idea of this
 is to create and document my own self study curriculum. This enables me to learn as I go and figure out what to
  learn (and get critical feedback on it). At the same time, I aim to leave behind an ever growing portfolio of
   projects. To sum it up, its about learning and creating value in one go and as effective as possible.

A secondary benefit from the idea is that I also learn vital side skills and technologies that are must-know features
, but that are often forgotten and under-explored when it comes to the everyday learning of code. To just get a basic
 idea on what is meant here: Dev-ops for coders, marketing, personal-branding, communication skills, finance skills
  and much more.

## Starting off.

Within the first steps of the program, we need to figure out the major categories and set standards and deadlines for
 the intended learning. This includes a calendar, homework(where I still need to figure out a good way to impliment
  external accountability) and initial application to even get started. Over the course, I then can grow, practices
   and evolve to be ready for a job at a big tech company like Google, Apple, or Facebook. The course should also
    include practical team and real business
    experience. So getting an initial Job or internship, open source projects and commercial side projects will be
     vital in the process.
