So, today i am planning on starting my 12 week learning challenge planning session. But also writing a bit down so i can get my thoughts in order.

My first two books are the 12 week Year and Atomic Habit, and i intend to start writing about it in my first week between the 1st and the 8th of June. (Wow its winter officiall now).

The books combine really cool stuff on becoming and believing in a better self. One of my first challenges will be the Habit Scorecard. Its basically getting the day to day habits up into our awareness. The Scorecard is simply a tool, where each and every tiny habit & habit trigger is recorded in a list and then simply rated as good neutral or negative. The rating is obviously bias towards who you for yourself want to be.

Here is what the scorecard looks like. You can see I drink a lot of coffee right?

Getting that awareness up is great. The list isn't really a finished product but more continous work in progress, and updating it regularly seems like a good habit in itself. Somewhat like the point-n-shout method explained int he book.

Another important part covered in the book is the Habit loop and how to use it to your advantage. Its simple stuff, but if done repeatedly bears great effects. A simple but small technique is taking the scorecard and stacking desired habits on top of that, to always have a cue ready for the right habits to perform.

A large part of setting yourself up for the right action is to rather focus on setting up an environment that triggers you thinking about the right actions at the right moments. Discipline & willpower are rather inefficient when trying to change habits. This also leads to the two step cue setup. Instead of telling yourself that: "At 4pm i'm going to eat 2 apples", tell yourself (or better write it down) that there needs to be apples available at 4pm (and make sure this happens). This seems at first counterintuitive, and a lot of work goes into not getting any results at all. But this work is very easy to do and requires much less initial willpower, plus it gets the same results done more routinely. (claim)

Add on to scorecard - add onto the list whats missing - when other things could be done - like chores that might be better on a habit routine.

The last chapter i went through was the first one about working on the habit Craving. The book explains very well that cravings are based on dopamine being released in anticipation of the reward. This causes motivation to get into action. Often the dopamine released once a cue is seen is even stronger than the actual reward. This is obviously done so we can take action in a more default state than having to use mental capacity to jump to action. As we learned before, willpower is a bad way to get habits going.

The way to make a habit stick better at the craving stage is by making it irresistable. At the beginning, we learned about habit Stacking. Here we can use the anticipation of a reward from another habit an stack it with the craving. For example, if you like to eat sweets at night, tell yourself that tonight you will eat 2 apples and only then you are allowed to eat a sweet. Thus, the craving for the sweet will slowly overlap and distinguis itself as a craving for apples.

excited to see whats next up, more coming tonight when I read 2 more chapters, then have a sweet and brush my teeth.

Today I will go to Plett with Liz, Lucy & john to visit my parents. I will have only 1-2 small glasses of wine & limit my alcohol consumption.
Today, I will Iron the Laundry in my office while watching a coding tutorial on Youtube at 16:00.
Today, I will read 2 chapters in bed before sleeping, and I will brush my teeth afterwards.

Today, I will buy Apples & look at potential other snacks to keep around in the house & my office. - When?
