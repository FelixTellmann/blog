So, today i am planning on starting my 12 week learning challenge planning session. But also writing a bit down so i can get my thoughts in order.

My first two books are the 12 week Year and Atomic Habit, and i intend to start writing about it in my first week between the 1st and the 8th of June. (Wow its winter officiall now).

The books combine really cool stuff on becoming and believing in a better self. One of my first challenges will be the Habit Scorecard. Its basically getting the day to day habits up into our awareness. The Scorecard is simply a tool, where each and every tiny habit & habit trigger is recorded in a list and then simply rated as good neutral or negative. The rating is obviously bias towards who you for yourself want to be.

Here is what the scorecard looks like. You can see I drink a lot of coffee right?

Getting that awareness up is great. The list isn't really a finished product but more continous work in progress, and updating it regularly seems like a good habit in itself. Somewhat like the point-n-shout method explained int he book.

Another important part covered in the book is the Habit loop and how to use it to your advantage. Its simple stuff, but if done repeatedly bears great effects. A simple but small technique is taking the scorecard and stacking desired habits on top of that, to always have a cue ready for the right habits to perform.



Today I will start on the Habit tracking scorecard, right after I'm done with the invoices for Kids Living
