So, today i am planning on starting my 12 week learning challenge planning session. But also writing a bit down so i can get my thoughts in order.

My first two books are the 12 week Year and Atomic Habit, and i intend to start writing about it in my first week between the 1st and the 8th of June. (Wow its winter officiall now).

The books combine really cool stuff on becoming and believing in a better self. One of my first challenges will be the Habit Scorecard. Its basically getting the day to day habits up into our awareness. The Scorecard is simply a tool, where each and every tiny habit & habit trigger is recorded in a list and then simply rated as good neutral or negative. The rating is obviously bias towards who you for yourself want to be.

I will start my storecard today at 1pm for at least 45 minutes.
I will start a chore with audiobooks at 11am for at least 1 hour
I will eat a healthy afternoon lunch/dinner at 4pm, with lots of veg.
I will run with Alpha at 2pm for 30 minutes in the forest.
I will sort out the VAT & Financial Statements for the Burger Exchange today at 6pm and send it through to PKF once finished.

I will invoice KidsLiving for my work completed tomorrow morning at 9am - first thing when going on the computer!
