Who is my target-market / hero & problem ?
  -
  1. Companies looking to hire a good fit - 
    someone contributing to their bottom line -
    Someone who makes the team better
    Easy to hire - common questions pre-answered
  2. Small - medium sized businesses who need a website / don't
    have a good website / don't have sales through their site
    Doesn't know how to even start - write a brief
    Doesn't know what business analysis to perform to create focused copy
    

How am I the guide ?
1. Easy to hire (for HR manager - CV - all necessary info easy available)
    Public portfolio of work completed
    blog about teaching & contributing on specific technologies - proving skills
    Know-how about business tools & good commounication
    Easy to contact - email? hello@
    
2. Offering help in even getting started
   - Business Canvas - Analysis of their customers
   - StoryBrand
   - Focus on growing their business & continuously managing their content
    * Help you sell/convert/get leads - Faster loading websites - Easy access for changes for you - look great on any device
   - Highly transparent process with clear communication on partner dashboard
  (how to get someone to actually use it?)
   - Must be much easier than wordpress
   - include basic dev-ops done under the hood - obviously charge for.

3. Free information  - know how - passively via blog
    - Using good fitting content for the two target markets:
        - Focus on tech & teaching co-workers code (tutorials)
        - Focus on Business growth & going online with a brand identity.
