    - Save time - learning tech yourself or knowing what to put on to the
     website - save proven process to folllow - like 1.2.3.

    /retainer + easy to use backend - to change just enough for their needs
    /input - communicate that they own the site.

## What is their problem?
Villains: Personification of problems - should be one single one - simple to
 explain

Example Villains:
  - Information Overflow - being stuck with too much information and not
   knowing where to start
  - Deadlines & Budgets (Project contrains) - Limited Resources - Think Wix Ads
  - Complexity of Code - Just seeing code as something too hard to graps
  - similar to information overflow
  - Bad hiring/contracting decisions 
  - customers not knowing that they actually need marketing advice & strategy before they should look at their
    website.
  - Bad hiring decision (for potential employers)(counter with contractual
   employment options) 
  - Ugly Websites that don't sell - looking like its 1995 - No clicks/views
  /conversions

External Problems:
  - Ugly Website
  - No Sales - No Sales channel
  - No Website
  - Poor SEO, performance, other tech part that is desired
  - No plan for a  website
  - I need a person for this position.
  - Can he do what his CV says?
  - Can he do what I need for the business
  - Does this tutorial help me? does it answer my question?

Internal Problems:
  - I don't even know where to start - this is overwhelmingly complex
  - I don't know what drives people to my website - I need a marketing strategy?
  - My business is suffering, a website should solve my problems right?
  - If I don't fill this position within this week, I might get fired/project
   deadline missed etc.
  - 
  
Philosophical:
  - Just having a website isn't good enough in todays world - you gotta have
   a one that works for you
  - Finding a good fit for your company should be easy
  - There is no such thing as a perfect talent fit - but you can hire someone
   who can learn fast

## How am I the guide ?
1. Easy to hire (for HR manager - CV - all necessary info easy available)
    Public portfolio of work completed
    blog about teaching & contributing on specific technologies - proving skills
    Know-how about business tools & good communication
    Easy to contact - email? hello@
    
2. Offering help in even getting started
   - Business Canvas - Analysis of their customers
   - StoryBrand
   - Focus on growing their business & continuously managing their content
    * Help you sell/convert/get leads - Faster loading websites - Easy access for changes for you - look great on any device
   - Highly transparent process with clear communication on partner dashboard
  (how to get someone to actually use it?)
   - Must be much easier than wordpress
   - include basic dev-ops done under the hood - obviously charge for.

3. Free information  - know how - passively via blog
    - Using good fitting content for the two target markets:
        - Focus on tech & teaching co-workers code (tutorials)
        - Focus on Business growth & going online with a brand identity.


### Gaining TRUST and RESPECT through EMPATHY (share vulnerability) and AUTHORITY (demonstrating
 competence)
 
Empathy:
1. Companys looking for a Job 
    - I've been there, having to hire staff for restaurants, I know that it
     can be incredibly difficult
    - I believe that finding a good fit (especially culture fit) is not just
     important for the company but for myself too. I won't let you hire me
      just for my skills (protecting you from making a bad hire decision for
       YOUR culture)
    - I'm always keen to learn new things, new languages, new tech as I
     embrace a new project - Just because I might not now your stack right
      now, doesn't mean I can't do the job. Do you want to hire who knows the
       stack and doesn't invest into learning or someone who learns what is
        needed for any job?

2. Businesses looking for freelancer - developer
    - I've started quite a few businesses, and I've been stuck many many times when it comes to wirting copy & creating content.
    - Creating a marketing plan for a website is super important, but all we want to do is start right into it and then get frustrated when we get stuck, because we don't actully know what to do next.
    - You can have the most beautiful website and still don't make sales, i've been there. Start with a plan

3. Other Coders looking for help
    - I've been stuck with this same problem for some time
    - I get stuck all the same time too - use of super awesome developer tutorials - thats why this is so important
    - Check out Academind for some insight in their content on how they answer Empathy to their audience
    
Authority (demonstrating competence & show the numbers?):
1. Companies:
    - Portfolio of previous done websites - show their success
    - Testimonials of how I work
    - Examples and freebees for coming up with a compelling strategy for the website
    - Blog Posts
